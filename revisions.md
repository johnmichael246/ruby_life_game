# Revisions/Refactor 
Things that I would do, or do differently, provided more time:

1. TESTS!!!
I would have written/tested the code outside irb, and taken a more TDD approach. Given the time and my desire to have something completed, I didnt develop in this manner.

2. an executable with input
I would have made the program run from outside of the IRB console, as a single executable file.

3. validations | error handling
I would have made the code, especially that dealing with initializing of the multidimensional state array, more robust, with more graceful handling (and exiting if need be).

4. Did I mention tests?
